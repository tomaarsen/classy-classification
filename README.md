# Classy Classification
Have you every struggled with needing a [Spacy TextCategorizer](https://spacy.io/api/textcategorizer) but didn't have the time to train one from scratch? Classy Classification is the way to go! For few-shot classification using [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) or [spaCy models](https://spacy.io/usage/models), provide a dictionary with labels and examples, or just provide a list of labels for zero shot-classification with [Hugginface zero-shot classifiers](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification).

# Install
``` pip install classy-classification```

or install with faster inference using onnx.

``` pip install classy-classification[onnx]```

## ONNX issues

### pickling

ONNX does show some issues when pickling the data.
### M1
Some [installation issues](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3129) might occur, which can be fixed by these commands.

```
brew install cmake
brew install protobuf
pip3 install onnx --no-use-pep517
```

# Quickstart
## SpaCy embeddings
```python
import spacy
import classy_classification

data = {
    "furniture": ["This text is about chairs.",
               "Couches, benches and televisions.",
               "I really need to get a new sofa."],
    "kitchen": ["There also exist things like fridges.",
                "I hope to be getting a new stove today.",
                "Do you also have some ovens."]
}

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
nlp.add_pipe(
    "text_categorizer",
    config={
        "data": data,
        "model": "spacy"
    }
)

print(nlp("I am looking for kitchen appliances.")._.cats)

# Output:
#
# [{"label": "furniture", "score": 0.21}, {"label": "kitchen", "score": 0.79}]
```
### Multi-label classification
Sometimes multiple labels are necessary to fully describe the contents of a text. In that case, we want to make use of the **multi-label** implementation, here the sum of label scores is not limited to 1. Note that we use a multi-layer perceptron for this purpose instead of the default `SVC` implementation, requiring a few more training samples.

```python
import spacy
import classy_classification

data = {
    "furniture": ["This text is about chairs.",
               "Couches, benches and televisions.",
               "I really need to get a new sofa.",
               "We have a new dinner table."],
    "kitchen": ["There also exist things like fridges.",
                "I hope to be getting a new stove today.",
                "Do you also have some ovens.",
                "We have a new dinner table."]
}

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
nlp.add_pipe(
    "text_categorizer",
    config={
        "data": data,
        "model": "spacy",
        "cat_type": "multi-label",
        "config": {"hidden_layer_sizes": (64,), "seed": 42}
    }
)

print(nlp("texts about dinner tables have multiple labels.")._.cats)

# Output:
#
# [{"label": "furniture", "score": 0.94}, {"label": "kitchen", "score": 0.97}]
```
## Sentence-transfomer embeddings
```python
import spacy
import classy_classification

data = {
    "furniture": ["This text is about chairs.",
               "Couches, benches and televisions.",
               "I really need to get a new sofa."],
    "kitchen": ["There also exist things like fridges.",
                "I hope to be getting a new stove today.",
                "Do you also have some ovens."]
}

nlp = spacy.blank("en")
nlp.add_pipe(
    "text_categorizer",
    config={
        "data": data,
        "model": "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2",
        "device": "gpu"
    }
)

print(nlp("I am looking for kitchen appliances.")._.cats)

# Output:
#
# [{"label": "furniture", "score": 0.21}, {"label": "kitchen", "score": 0.79}]
```
## Hugginface zero-shot classifiers
```python
import spacy
import classy_classification

data = ["furniture", "kitchen"]

nlp = spacy.blank("en")
nlp.add_pipe(
    "text_categorizer",
    config={
        "data": data,
        "model": "typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli",
        "cat_type": "zero",
        "device": "gpu"
    }
)

print(nlp("I am looking for kitchen appliances.")._.cats)

# Output:
#
# [{"label": "furniture", "score": 0.21}, {"label": "kitchen", "score": 0.79}]
```

## Inspiration Drawn From
[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) does offer some nice models for few/zero-shot classification, but these are not tailored to multi-lingual approaches. Rasa NLU has [a nice approach](https://rasa.com/blog/rasa-nlu-in-depth-part-1-intent-classification/) for this, but its too embedded in their codebase for easy usage outside of Rasa/chatbots. Additionally, it made sense to integrate [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and [Hugginface zero-shot](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification), instead of default [word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781). Finally, I decided to integrate with Spacy, since training a custom [Spacy TextCategorizer](https://spacy.io/api/textcategorizer) seems like a lot of hassle if you want something quick and dirty.

classifier = ClassyClassifier(data=data)
classifier("I am looking for kitchen appliances.")
classifier.pipe(["I am looking for kitchen appliances."])

# overwrite training data

# overwrite [embedding model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html)
classifier.set_embedding_model(model="paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2")
